In early 2020, the Swiss-Chinese Bridge Association and the Zurich Students' Federation jointly organized a Sino-Swiss cultural exchange event. The event featured Swiss musicians Jason Huster, Anton Zemp and his friends. Anton Zemp and his friends play the traditional Swiss instrument Alphorn and share with you the cultural background of this instrument. Jason Huster shared how he met Lang Lang and performed together. He also played the piano for the group.
