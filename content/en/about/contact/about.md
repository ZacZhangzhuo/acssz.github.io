## About Us

Founded in the mid-1980s, ACSSZ has a history of more than 30 years. It is a caring family of local students and scholars. The mission of the Federation is to serve Chinese students and scholars, to connect and unite alumni, Chinese and overseas Chinese, to serve the Chinese community in Zurich, to promote Chinese culture, and to promote cultural exchanges and mutual understanding between China and Switzerland.

We organize all kinds of wonderful activities to help you complete your studies, gain career and find a bosom friend in a strange land far away from home.

In 2019, the new Student Federation has a presidium composed of the president and five vice presidents, which is in charge of six departments, namely publicity, secretariat, sports, public relations, and corporate liaison. The current Executive Committee consists of a total of 14 people, including the presidium and vice-ministers of various departments.
