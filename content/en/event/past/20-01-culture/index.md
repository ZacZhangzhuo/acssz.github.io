At the beginning of 2020, the Switzerland-China Bridge Association and the Zurich Federation of Students jointly held a Sino-Swiss cultural exchange activity. The event featured Swiss musicians Jason Huster, Anton Zemp and his friends. Anton Zemp and his friends play Alphorn, a traditional Swiss musical instrument, and share the cultural background of this instrument. Jason Huster shared how he met Lang Lang and performed together. He also played piano for everyone at the event.
