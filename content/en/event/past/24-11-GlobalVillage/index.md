🌏✨ Today, we joined AIESEC Zurich at “Global Village - Embrace Diversity” at the University of Zurich, Lichthof! 🇨🇳🇨🇭

Our team loved sharing a bit of Chinese culture—guests got to try on Hanfu, practice calligraphy, and make bubble tea 🍵✍️💫. It was inspiring to see everyone embracing these experiences, from Hanfu try-ons to brushstrokes of calligraphy.

Huge thanks to everyone who stopped by and to AIESEC Zurich for creating such a welcoming, inclusive space that truly celebrates openness, diversity, and shared understanding! We look forward to sharing even more of China’s traditions with our international friends in the future! 🌍
